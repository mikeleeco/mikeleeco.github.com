## Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/timss/)

The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international comparative study that measures trends in mathematics and science achievement at the 4th and 8th grades every 4 years. TIMSS is designed to align broadly with mathematics and science curricula in the participating education systems and, therefore, to reflect students'school-based learning. The United States has participated in every administration of TIMSS since its inception in 1995, and the study provides valuable information on how U.S. students compare to students around the world.

## Development

For this project I acted as data and visualization specialist on a team of designers, web developers, and content area experts to produce this summary release for the National Center for Education Statistics website. The TIMSS summary release is designed to assist the general public in better understanding the most recent results of national and international surveys, embedded with static and interactive visualizations.

## Software

- **R**: Data cleaning and json production
- **D3.js**: Visualization
