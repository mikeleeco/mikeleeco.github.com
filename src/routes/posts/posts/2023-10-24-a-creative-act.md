When you work full-time at a beach, worthy sandcastles are documented. After 24 hours destroyed. Ocean rocks are ground down. Shells mangled. A new beach recycled every night. 

When you work full-time in a sandbox, sandcastles are documented with no fear of the tide to wash it away. No new sand to recycle the box. Castles don't look quite as majestic without the ocean. The permanance of your craft somehow seems daunting. So you may step away until you're excited by a new sets of tools. Your old ones can surely do the job but these new ones seem cool. And maybe a new sandbox would be nice.

I've been incrementally building up a full stack word game web app. Going from idea to code felt like rowing against the tide. Using R/Python for word manipulation and coding the front end in svelte. It will process payment subscriptions, send automated emails, and store user data. Pretty excited learning a new tech stack and hoping to release it by the end of the year.

A point is an idea intentionally expressed. A point of view is a perspective through which the work emerges. What causes us to notice a piece of art is rarely the point being made. We are drawn to the way an artistâ€™s filter refracts ideas, not the ideas themselves (Rick Rubin, The Creative Act: a Way of Being, Penguin Press, New York, 2023, p. 179).

We don't need to make a point of making a point. It will appear when it appears. The true point is already made in the innocent act of perception and creation. Knowing this is liberating. It lifts some pressure...We are free to present and allow the material to come through us, and free to stay out of its way when it does come through.(Rick Rubin, Ibid., p. 179)

To hear whispers, the mind must also be quiet. We pay close attention on all fronts. Our antennae sensitively tuned...In addition to meditation, we might softly hold on to a question and go for a walk, swim, or drive. The question isn't being worked on, just loosely held in awareness. We are positing it gently to the Universe and opening ourselves to receive an answer...we allow it to come by grace, not effort. The whisper cannot be wrestled into existence, only welcomed with an open state of mind.(Rick Rubin, Ibid., p. 270)

"When we are struck by an epiphany, our experience of what's possible has been expanded. In that instant, we are broken open. If lightning should strike, and this information is channeled through the aether to us, what follows is a great deal of practical work. While we can't command a lightning bolt's arrival, we can control the space around it...(p 289-290)

"Like carpenters, we show up each day and do our job. Sculptors knead clay, sweep the studio floor, and lock up for the night. Graphic designers sit at their workstations, select images, choose fonts, create layouts, and hit _save_."(Rick Rubin, Ibid., p. 290)

"Artists are ultimately craftspeople. Sometimes our ideas come through bolts of lightning. Other times through effort, experiment, and craft. As we work, we may notice connections and become surprised by the wonder of what's revealed through the doing itself. In a way, these small a-ha! moments are also bolts of lightning. Less vivid, they illuminate our way."(Rick Rubin, Ibid., p. 290)

"Without diligence, inspiration alone rarely yields work of much consequence. Making great art may not always require great effort, but without it, you'll never know. If inspiration calls, we ride the lightning until the energy is exhausted.

The ride may not last long. But we are grateful for the opportunity. If inspiration does not come lead the way. We show up anyway."(Rick Rubin, Ibid., p. 291)
