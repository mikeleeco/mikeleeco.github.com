```{r setup knitr, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, dpi = 180, out.extra='class = "img-responsive"')

```

```{r setup, echo = F}

  if (before){
    paste0('<', options$wrap, '>')

    paste0('</', options$wrap, '>')

## Mastering Animation in R

Last week I wrote a post about recreating the WSJ measles vaccination chart as an animated cartogram - you can check out the full write-up of the development here: [www.mikelee.co/posts/2017-06-28-wsj-measles-vaccination-chart/](www.mikelee.co/posts/2017-06-28-wsj-measles-vaccination-chart/)

It was featured on DataCamp across all their [social](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6288400911173709824) [media](https://twitter.com/DataCamp/status/882634632935735296) [platforms](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1656557754368698&id=726282547396228) - pretty neat!

A comment from one of the readers (which disqus seems to have overwritten as I was re-initializing my site) read as so:

> Your measles chart is a beautiful piece of work! No question. The (vertical) sorting merely by alphabetic state listing, however, adds nothing to the information. Even better, I think, would be to place these stats on a US map. The animation would then show the geographic progress of the disease. Try first on a state basis; counties would be too confusing The ultimate presentation, however, would show the importance of high population densities (metropolitan areas).  - Kenneth Holland.

That's an interesting idea Kenneth!

I wonder whether a similar type of graphic representation was considered by the WSJ authors. Either way, this is a great excuse to jump on the [Makeover Monday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) train.

## Makeover the WSJ Measles Incidence Visualization as a Cartogram
Given that I've already completed the data acquisition and manipulation in my previous post, I'll jump right into plotting the state level data. The county-level piece is an interesting idea, but I'll leave that for someone else!

Here is the final result:

![Measles Animation Cartogram](/img/measlesCartogram.gif)

I customized the plot in a few ways - first, I chose to represent the change in time via a timeline above the cartogram. Other developers have represented change in time using years as text - such as the [Financial Times' income distribution gif](https://i.imgur.com/a2BEHjL.gif) (their original post [here](https://www.ft.com/content/98ce14ee-99a6-11e5-95c7-d47aa298f769?mhq5j=e2))

I selected a moving dot for a few reasons:
- given the large selection of years, a frequently changing portion of the image would be a distraction
- the movement of the dot is an intuitive representation of change over time
- the point could be encoded with data - the color represents the national mean incidence!

The final product is a quality alternative to the WSJ's original visualization, though I prefer the original representation as a full grid over years - the drastic reduction in measles incidence is more impactful with 30+ years of negligible incidence stacked up next to each other. Have other thoughts? Leave them in the comments (hopefully disqus doesn't delete em this time :stuck_out_tongue:)
