      <description>Background The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the United States. The AIR social media team uses https://twitter.com/EdNCES to broadcast and disseminate the education-related data of the center to the public.
Goal In an effort to expand the outreach and discoverability of NCES research, the social media team sought to make NCES&#39; static publication figures more impactful through the use of animation.</description>

      <title>Automated Reports - Nevada Department of Education</title>
      <link>/projects/2019-12-30-automated-report-nevada/</link>

      <guid>/projects/2019-12-30-automated-report-nevada/</guid>
      <description>Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&amp;rsquo;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/) The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures 15-year-old students&#39; reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. First conducted in 2000, the major domain of study rotates between reading, mathematics, and science in each cycle. PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/) The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) is a computer-based international assessment of 8th-grade students&#39; capacities &amp;ldquo;to use information communications technologies (ICT) productively for a range of different purposes, in ways that go beyond a basic use of ICT&amp;rdquo; (Fraillon et al., 2018). First conducted in 2013, ICILS assessed students’ computer and information literacy (CIL) with an emphasis on the use of computers as information-seeking, management, and communication tools.</description>

      <guid>/projects/2019-12-30-teacher-student-shiny-application/</guid>
      <description>Background The Center on Great Teachers and Leader&amp;rsquo;s (GTL Center) mission is to support states and districts in their efforts to grow, respect, and retain great teachers and leaders for all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The GTL Center has an Excel data tool that is used to reveal insights about the diversity of the educator workforce at the state, district, school, or EPP level. One component of this tool that was missing was a method to map and explore teacher and student ethnicity data by school district.</description>

      <guid>/projects/2019-06-28-iap-talis-summary-release/</guid>
      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/) The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) is a survey about teachers, teaching, and learning environments. Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), TALIS is composed of two questionnaires—one for teachers and one for their principals—which ask questions about their backgrounds, their work environments, professional development, and their beliefs and attitudes about teaching. TALIS is unique because it is the only comparative international education study that collects data on nationally representative samples of teachers.</description>

      <guid>/projects/2018-11-20-automated-report-cleveland-metropolitan-school-district/</guid>
      <description>Background Each Fall and Spring the Cleveland Metropolitan School District disseminates a summary report detailing results from a survey assessing four social-emotional learning constructs within elementary, middle and high schools. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor; one such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&amp;rsquo;s customized report.</description>

      <title>EdSurvey - R package (CRAN)</title>
      <link>/projects/2017-06-03-edsurvey-r-package/</link>

      <guid>/projects/2017-06-03-edsurvey-r-package/</guid>
      <description>Background National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) require special statistical methods to analyze. Because of their scope and complexity, users with computers that have insufficient memory to read in entire NAEP data sets might have trouble conducting analyses without having to write special code to read in just the appropriate variables.
Goal Develop an R package that gives users functions to perform analyses that account for both complex sample survey designs and the use of plausible values – behind the scenes and without any special tuning by the user.</description>

      <description>Background National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) require special statistical methods to analyze. Because of their scope and complexity, users with computers that have insufficient memory to read in entire NAEP data sets might have trouble conducting analyses without having to write special code to read in just the appropriate variables.
Goal Develop an R package that would contain a random mini-sample of real data from the 2005 grade 8 mathematics assessment that have been approved for public use.</description>
