      <description>Inspiration Virtually following along with rstudio::conf 2020 (and having major conference envy) I heard about Claus Wilke’s new package ggtext. The package supports HTML and markdown styling for text and annotations in ggplot2 graphics. If you’re familiar with HTML or D3.js this seems like a basic feature, but in R graphics this functionality is not natively supported.
Reading this recent 538 article I noticed a neat stacked bar chart:</description>

      <description>Mastering the R package ggplot2 The ggplot2 package provides powerful methods to display data as graphics. The beauty of the package lies in it’s simplicity - understanding the core methods (applying variables to aesthetics and transformations) covers ~95% of static visualizations a data visualization developer might be interested in generating. Most of final 5% can be achieved by understanding the infrastructure of the package. One such example is how plot components are “written” to the graphics device.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/timss/) The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures 15-year-old students&#39; reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. First conducted in 2000, the major domain of study rotates between reading, mathematics, and science in each cycle. PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.</description>

      <guid>/projects/2019-12-30-automated-report-nevada/</guid>
      <description>Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&amp;rsquo;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/) The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) is a computer-based international assessment of 8th-grade students&#39; capacities &amp;ldquo;to use information communications technologies (ICT) productively for a range of different purposes, in ways that go beyond a basic use of ICT&amp;rdquo; (Fraillon et al., 2018). First conducted in 2013, ICILS assessed students’ computer and information literacy (CIL) with an emphasis on the use of computers as information-seeking, management, and communication tools.</description>

      <description>Background The Center on Great Teachers and Leader&amp;rsquo;s (GTL Center) mission is to support states and districts in their efforts to grow, respect, and retain great teachers and leaders for all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The GTL Center has an Excel data tool that is used to reveal insights about the diversity of the educator workforce at the state, district, school, or EPP level. One component of this tool that was missing was a method to map and explore teacher and student ethnicity data by school district.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/) The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) is a survey about teachers, teaching, and learning environments. Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), TALIS is composed of two questionnaires—one for teachers and one for their principals—which ask questions about their backgrounds, their work environments, professional development, and their beliefs and attitudes about teaching. TALIS is unique because it is the only comparative international education study that collects data on nationally representative samples of teachers.</description>

      <description>Mastering Animation in R Over the last couple years I’ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process I’ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
    One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewer’s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.</description>

      <description>Hot Take Alert 🔥 Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history 🔥
 Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylor’s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.</description>

      <description>This April I’m visiting Zion National Park, one of North America’s most interesting locations to explore geologic formations. One such venue in the park is an iconic hike referred to as The Narrows:
The Narrows in Zion National Park
 It’s surely even more sensational in person.
Unfortunately, there’s a catch: the Virgin River, a Colorado river tributary that shaped the distinct rock walls of The Narrows, has seasonal water level changes that can force hikers to trek waist deep in the river or close the route entirely.</description>

      <description>Background National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) require special statistical methods to analyze. Because of their scope and complexity, users with computers that have insufficient memory to read in entire NAEP data sets might have trouble conducting analyses without having to write special code to read in just the appropriate variables.
Goal Develop an R package that gives users functions to perform analyses that account for both complex sample survey designs and the use of plausible values – behind the scenes and without any special tuning by the user.</description>

      <description>Background National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data sets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) require special statistical methods to analyze. Because of their scope and complexity, users with computers that have insufficient memory to read in entire NAEP data sets might have trouble conducting analyses without having to write special code to read in just the appropriate variables.
Goal Develop an R package that would contain a random mini-sample of real data from the 2005 grade 8 mathematics assessment that have been approved for public use.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Your home state did us no favors&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; As a Wisconsinite transplanted into the highest density of left-leaning voters in the country (District of Columbia) I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from several friends over the weeks in the aftermath of the US presidential election that voters in my home state should shoulder responsibility for contributing to Donald Trump winning an electoral majority.
The &amp;ldquo;winner-take-all&amp;rdquo; basis in which electoral votes are allocated means the margin of victory in each state is null - extra votes don&amp;rsquo;t matter - which contributes to an outcome in which a winning candidate can have fewer total votes than another nominee.</description>

      <description>Original Source
I was scrolling twitter and noticed this tweet from David Sparks - Director of Basketball Analytics for the Boston Celtics:
With thanks to @hadleywickham, @hrbrmstr, and @ColorBrewer. #rstats https://t.co/hjX39Xhi4P https://t.co/XD27alzwNI
&amp;mdash; David Sparks (@dsparks) April 22, 2016  With his obligatory shoutouts to Hadley Wickham and BoB Rudis, I felt compelled to reproduce the plot in RStudio and get some ggplot2 code out there open-sourcing his work.

  Video games have long infiltrated popular culture. This article will attempt to explain that reach. Inspired by FiveThirtyEight&#39;s great article &#34;Designing the Best Board Game on the Planet&#34;, I set out to extend this methodology to video games. The focus of 538&#39;s research related to a robust data set pulled from BoardGameGeek, an exhaustive collection of board games contributed by it&#39;s passionate users.</description>

      <title>Working with Minor League Similarity Scores</title>

      <description>There are some people who see baseball players that way-each one is unique, absolutely not interchangeable with another. I don&#39;t deny the validity of that approach-but if you take that tack, then you can&#39;t turn around and argue that your player should be in the Hall of Fame because his numbers are just as good as this other player&#39;s. &#34;Similarity&#34; is a complex concept, and two players who are not statistically similar may be profoundly similar in some other way.</description>

      <description>Baseball is a game of numbers, some more accessible than others. Rates, averages, linear weights, aging curves, and WAR are only a few of the myriad statistics influencing decision makers in MLB franchises. An endless amount of data is accessible to the average fan at many sites, most notably the Lahman Baseball Database, which is the most robust catalog of MLB player statistics available to the public.One area of relatively limited accessibility to the average fan is statistics for Minor League players.</description>
