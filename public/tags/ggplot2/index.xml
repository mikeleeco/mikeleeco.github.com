      <description>InspirationVirtually following along with rstudio::conf 2020 (and having major conference envy) I heard about Claus Wilke’s new package ggtext. The package supports HTML and markdown styling for text and annotations in ggplot2 graphics. If you’re familiar with HTML or D3.js this seems like a basic feature, but in R graphics this functionality is not natively supported.
Reading this recent 538 article I noticed a neat stacked bar chart:</description>

      <description>Mastering the R package ggplot2The ggplot2 package provides powerful methods to display data as graphics. The beauty of the package lies in it’s simplicity - understanding the core methods (applying variables to aesthetics and transformations) covers ~95% of static visualizations a data visualization developer might be interested in generating. Most of final 5% can be achieved by understanding the infrastructure of the package. One such example is how plot components are “written” to the graphics device.</description>

      <description>Mastering Animation in ROver the last couple years I’ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process I’ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewer’s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.</description>

      <description>Hot Take Alert🔥 Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history 🔥
Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylor’s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.</description>

The Narrows in Zion National Park
It’s surely even more sensational in person.
Unfortunately, there’s a catch: the Virgin River, a Colorado river tributary that shaped the distinct rock walls of The Narrows, has seasonal water level changes that can force hikers to trek waist deep in the river or close the route entirely.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a post about recreating the WSJ measles vaccination chart as an animated cartogram - you can check out the full write-up of the development here: www.mikelee.co/posts/2017-06-28-wsj-measles-vaccination-chart/
It was featured on DataCamp across all their social media platforms - pretty neat!
A comment from one of the readers (which disqus seems to have overwritten as I was re-initializing my site) read as so:

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Your home state did us no favors&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; As a Wisconsinite transplanted into the highest density of left-leaning voters in the country (District of Columbia) I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from several friends over the weeks in the aftermath of the US presidential election that voters in my home state should shoulder responsibility for contributing to Donald Trump winning an electoral majority.
The &amp;ldquo;winner-take-all&amp;rdquo; basis in which electoral votes are allocated means the margin of victory in each state is null - extra votes don&amp;rsquo;t matter - which contributes to an outcome in which a winning candidate can have fewer total votes than another nominee.</description>

      <description>Original Source
I was scrolling twitter and noticed this tweet from David Sparks - Director of Basketball Analytics for the Boston Celtics:
With thanks to @hadleywickham, @hrbrmstr, and @ColorBrewer. #rstats https://t.co/hjX39Xhi4P https://t.co/XD27alzwNI
&amp;mdash; David Sparks (@dsparks) April 22, 2016 
With his obligatory shoutouts to Hadley Wickham and BoB Rudis, I felt compelled to reproduce the plot in RStudio and get some ggplot2 code out there open-sourcing his work.

  Video games have long infiltrated popular culture. This article will attempt to explain that reach. Inspired by FiveThirtyEight&#39;s great article &#34;Designing the Best Board Game on the Planet&#34;, I set out to extend this methodology to video games. The focus of 538&#39;s research related to a robust data set pulled from BoardGameGeek, an exhaustive collection of board games contributed by it&#39;s passionate users.</description>
