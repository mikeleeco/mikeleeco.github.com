    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Mastering Animation in R Over the last couple years I’ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process I’ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
    One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewer’s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.
