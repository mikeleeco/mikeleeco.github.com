    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Mastering Animation in R Over the last couple years I’ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process I’ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
    One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewer’s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.

        This April I’m visiting Zion National Park, one of North America’s most interesting locations to explore geologic formations. One such venue in the park is an iconic hike referred to as The Narrows:
The Narrows in Zion National Park
 It’s surely even more sensational in person.
Unfortunately, there’s a catch: the Virgin River, a Colorado river tributary that shaped the distinct rock walls of The Narrows, has seasonal water level changes that can force hikers to trek waist deep in the river or close the route entirely.
