One component of this tool that was missing was a method to map and explore teacher and student ethnicity data by school district.</p> <p>The goal for this project was to develop a free, user-friendly tool to identify and visualize diversity gaps within states and school districts.</p> <h2>Development</h2> <p>For this project I acted as the lead developer in the creation of a Shiny application that would map diversity gaps at the state and district level.</p> <p>The application features an intuitive design. The left sidebar is used to export state and district level teacher data, prepopulated from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/tablegenerator.aspx" rel="nofollow">NCES table generator</a>. Users are then asked to add their student diversity statistics to the tool and re-upload. Finally, select a racial characteristic to generate the diversity gap map in the main panel.</p> <p>Linked are a <a href="/data/CALIFORNIA.csv">state</a> and <a href="/data/MilwaukeeSchoolDistrictWISCONSIN.csv">district</a> level data set populated with <em>dummy student data</em> that can be used to explore the tool - give it a try!</p> <h2>Software</h2> <ul><li><strong>R</strong>: Data cleaning and visualization</li> <li><strong>Shiny</strong>: User interface</li></ul>`;
